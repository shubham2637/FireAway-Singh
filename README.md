# FireAway-Singh
A mini project based on Django and JavaScript for Web Technologies Paper.
The project is based on MVC framework and Bootstrap CDN of Django and CSS respectively.

The entire project is an end user frontend dashboard to be used by different category of users.

The users have different privileges and control over the dashboard. 	

In mass mid segment, typically there will very few fire sensors and detectors connected to a panel in the site.

If we consider retain chain customers like Dominos, Vodafone, etc, they will be having 100s of such premises.

Having a physical security to monitor each location will be a costly and unaffordable solution. Thus require a solution that can help reduce the manual monitoring of systems across locations 24x7 remotely.

In case fire alarm occurs, person who is remotely monitoring shall alert the existing users & have their systems to decide on next step of actions to safeguard other users who plan to go to the premise in the upcoming days.
